This repository contains the codes for machine learning the phase transitions in materials. This is part of my PhD project to study phase transitions through machine learning techniques.

Metropolis Monte Carlo was used to simulate Ising model and interacting Jahn-Teller systems. The simulations were performed in a range of temperatures and a 2D PCA was used to project the data points on a 2D plane. The results clearly show how the data points cluster depending on their temperature. The high-temperature disordered phase forms a cluster around the (0,0) point, while the ordered structures form clusters elsewhere.
